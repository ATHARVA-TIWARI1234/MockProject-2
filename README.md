# Resume‚ÄìJob Description Matching Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to build an **AI-powered resume-job matching system** that evaluates how well a candidate's resume matches a given job description (JD). The system leverages **TF-IDF**, **transformer-based embeddings**, **feature engineering**, and multiple ML/DL models to achieve high accuracy.

## üìÇ Dataset & Preprocessing

### **1. Preprocessing (preprocess.py)**

* Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and normalization.
* Tokenization and stopword removal.
* Lemmatization for consistent word forms.
* Handles missing values and inconsistent formats.
* Outputs a **clean CSV**: `processed_data.csv`.

**Output Columns:**

* `resume_norm` ‚Üí Preprocessed resume text.
* `jd_norm` ‚Üí Preprocessed job description text.
* `label` ‚Üí Ground truth (1 = Match, 0 = No match).

---

## üß© Feature Engineering (feature\_engineering.py)

Feature engineering enhances the dataset using **semantic similarity** and **keyword-based matching**.

### **1. TF-IDF Vectorization**

* Uses `tfidf_resume.pkl` and `tfidf_jd.pkl`.
* Generates TF-IDF vectors for resumes & job descriptions.
* Computes **cosine similarity** between resume and JD vectors.

```python
score = cosine_similarity(tfidf_resume[i], tfidf_jd[i])[0][0]
df['cosine_sim_tfidf'] = cosine_sim_scores
```

### **2. Job Title Match**

Checks if any job title keywords from JD appear in the resume.

```python
def job_title_match(resume, jd):
    resume_words = set(resume.lower().split())
    jd_words = set(jd.lower().split())
    return 1 if len(resume_words & jd_words) > 0 else 0

df['job_title_match'] = df.apply(lambda x: job_title_match(x['resume_norm'], x['jd_norm']), axis=1)
```

### **3. Keyword Overlap**

Measures the ratio of overlapping words between JD and resume.

```python
def keyword_overlap(resume, jd):
    resume_set = set(resume.split())
    jd_set = set(jd.split())
    return len(resume_set & jd_set) / (len(jd_set) + 1e-6)

df['keyword_overlap'] = df.apply(lambda x: keyword_overlap(x['resume_norm'], x['jd_norm']), axis=1)
```

### **Final Output**

* Saves `processed_data_with_features.csv`.
* New Features:

  * `cosine_sim_tfidf`
  * `job_title_match`
  * `keyword_overlap`

## ü§ñ Models & Performance (Rank-wise)

We experimented with multiple ML/DL models.

## üìä TF-IDF Usage

The following pickle files are used:

* `tfidf_resume.pkl` ‚Üí TF-IDF vectors for resumes.
* `tfidf_jd.pkl` ‚Üí TF-IDF vectors for job descriptions.
* `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` ‚Üí Fitted vectorizer for inference.

These are essential for calculating `cosine_sim_tfidf`, a key feature for semantic similarity.
